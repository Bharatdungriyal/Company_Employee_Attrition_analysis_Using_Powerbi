# Company Employee Attrition Analysis Using Power BI

## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition using Power BI. The aim is to identify key factors influencing employee attrition and provide actionable insights for HR and management teams. We use a combination of data cleaning, processing, and visualization techniques to build an interactive dashboard.

## Project Structure

### 1. Dashboard Overview
The **Employee Attrition Dashboard** provides a comprehensive overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizations, enabling users to explore employee attrition data in depth.

### 2. Raw HR Analytics Data
We start with raw HR data that includes details on employee demographics, job roles, performance, satisfaction levels, and more. This data is used to explore patterns and trends that may lead to attrition.

### 3. Dashboard Setup
In this step, we set up the **Power BI Dashboard** by configuring the workspace, connecting data sources, and establishing relationships between tables.

### 4. Import Data in Power BI
Learn how to import the raw HR analytics data into Power BI for further analysis. This includes connecting to the data sources and preparing the environment for data processing.

### 5. Data Cleaning & Processing
This stage involves cleaning the raw HR data by:
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Standardizing data formats
- Preparing calculated columns

The goal is to ensure the dataset is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.

### 6. Power BI Dashboard - KPIs
The dashboard includes key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:
- Employee Attrition Rate
- Average Employee Satisfaction Score
- Job Role-wise Attrition Analysis
These KPIs help to track employee attrition trends across different dimensions.

### 7. Power BI Dashboard - Charts & Tables
The visualizations include:
- Attrition by Department and Job Role
- Employee Satisfaction vs Attrition Rate
- Demographics Breakdown (Age, Gender, Tenure, etc.)
- Line and bar charts, along with tables, are used to provide a clear understanding of the data.

### 8. Export or Share Power BI Dashboard
Once the analysis is complete, you can export or share the dashboard with stakeholders via:
- PDF export
- Power BI cloud sharing
- Embedding the dashboard in presentations or web pages

## Conclusion
The **Company Employee Attrition Analysis** project effectively analyzes employee turnover using Power BI. By leveraging visualizations and KPIs, this dashboard helps HR professionals and managers make informed decisions based on real-time data.
